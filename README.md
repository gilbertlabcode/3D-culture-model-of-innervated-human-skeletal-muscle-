To obtain the pieces:
Use SLA-3D printing or laser cutting, depends on tools available for you. We predict that one or two iterations of any technique will be needed to overcome offset of the machining and get the actual dimensions of what we use in the Gilbert lab.  For laser cutting (preferable method) we recommend to scale up the design. For 3D printing I would scale down and post-process the pieces to obtain smooth surfaces.
